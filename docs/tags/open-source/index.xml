      <description>We have amazing news! Gabriela de Queiroz is among the five finalists of the Red Hatâ€™s Women in Open Source Award (community track).
Please help Gabriela (and all the R-Ladies) win the award by voting until February 25th, 2019 here.
In this post, we tell you why we (all the authors listed below, except Gabriela, of course) nominated her for this competitive award and why it would be great for all R-Ladies that Gabriela wins this award.</description>
