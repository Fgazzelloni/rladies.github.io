[Gabriela de Queiroz](https://rladies.org/united-states-rladies/name/gabriela-de-queiroz/) founded R-Ladies on October 1, 2012. She wanted to give back to the community after going to several meetups and learning a lot for free.  The first meetup was placed in San Francisco, California (United States). 

In the following years two more R-Ladies chapters started around the globe: Twin Cities and Taipei. R-Ladies London was the fourth chapter, which launched in March 2016. Although each chapter started working independently, the need for high-level coordination and support became evident at useR! 2016 where the San Francisco and London chapters met. 

After some initial brainstorming during the useR! 2016 conference, [Gabriela de Queiroz](https://rladies.org/united-states-rladies/name/gabriela-de-queiroz/) and [Erin LeDell](https://rladies.org/r-speakers/name/erin-ledell/) from R-Ladies San Francisco and [Chiin-Rui Tan](https://rladies.org/r-speakers/name/chiin-rui-tan/), [Alice Daish](https://rladies.org/ladies-complete-list/name/alice-daish/), [Hannah Frick](https://rladies.org/ladies-complete-list/name/hannah-frick/), [Rachel Kirkham](https://rladies.org/ladies-complete-list/name/rachel-kirkham/) and [Claudia Vitolo](https://rladies.org/r-speakers/name/claudia-vitolo/) from R-Ladies London as well as Heather Turner teamed up to apply for an R-Consortium [grant to support and encourage the global expansion of the R-Ladies organisation](https://github.com/rladies/global/blob/master/rconsortium/FINAL%20-%20201607-%20rconsortiumproposalr-ladiesalignmentandglobalexpansion-july2016.pdf). 

R-Ladies Global was born and the grant was awarded in September 2016. Since then R-Ladies has grown to 63 chapters and 13000 members, thanks to our amazing organisers and R-Ladies who helped build and maintain our official website ([rladies.org](https://rladies.org/)), engage with the larger community via social media - ([\@RLadiesGlobal](https://twitter.com/rladiesglobal?lang=en)) and help each-other every day in millions of different ways.
