In this monthly workshop series, we will walk you through the fundamental uses of tidyverse and ggplot at your own pace with the help of hands-on exercises. Tidyverse and ggplot are a classic combination of R packages that allow you to \"wrangle\" your unwieldy data into whatever shape you need and creative beautiful and informative visualizations.<\/p> <p>Over the course of this series, you will learn the most useful features of R Studio and R Markdown, how to read in and explore data, and transform it into a shape that's easy to work with. You will be able to create new columns and summary tables, subset interesting rows or columns, and combine and reshape dataframes. We will also dive into ggplot, one of the best tools for creating great-looking bar charts, scatterplots, and more!<\/p> <p>This is (currently) a five-part series, aimed at total beginners and/or people with some experience in base-R or tidyverse who are looking to freshen up or expand their skills.

We are super excited to have Jill de Ron, PhD student at the psychological methods department of the University of Amsterdam (UvA) to bring you a workshop on Network analysis in R!<\/p> <p>DESCRIPTION<br/>-------------------<br/>We can use networks to provide insights into a variety of settings: A network connecting our Facebook friends gains understanding in our social structure; a human contact network gains insight into disease transmission; and a network of public transport lines informs us about the most central subway stations. In these examples, the relationships between components in the network are known. But in a lot of other cases, the relationships between components are unknown and are what we are interested in. For example, when we want to investigate the relationships between different personality traits. Network psychometrics makes it possible to estimate relationships between a large number of variables. Once you estimated a network, you can perform network-based statistics that give you information about the network’s local and global characteristics. In this workshop, you will learn how to estimate, analyze and interpret (psychological) network models. After a short introduction to network models, we will follow by a tutorial on analyzing data with network models.<\/p> <p>PROGRAMME<br/>----------------------<br/>18.30- 18.45 Virtual Welcome<br/>18.45- 20.30 Workshop and Q&amp;A<\/p> <p>ABOUT JILL<br/>-------------------<br/>I am a PhD student at the psychological methods department of the University of Amsterdam (UvA). My research is concerned with computational models of anxiety disorders and (formal) theory construction in psychology. I have a master’s degree in both Behavioral Data Science and Psychology. During my master programs I have been teaching assistant for the network analysis course at the UvA.<\/p> <p>PREREQUISITES<br/>-----------------------<br/>A basic knowledge of R is recommended. To join the tutorial, please install the bootnet package and the qgraph package.<\/p> <p>CODE OF CONDUCT<br/>----------------------------<br/>We expect all attendees to abide by our Code of Conduct.

His research is focussed on the intersection between mathematical modelling, data science, and networks in order to provide understanding of various complex systems. This has resulted in research describing the spreading of memes on social media, applying ideas from control theory to financial systems, and even identifying characteristics of successful competitors in Fantasy sports. You can find more information at <a href=\"https://www.joeyobrien.ie/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.joeyobrien.ie/<\/a><\/p> <p># Abstract<br/>Arising from the desire for spectators of sporting contests to obtain more enjoyment, Fantasy sports have become increasing popular in recent years. These sports involve competitors to create virtual teams that score points based upon the statistical performances of the physical athletes. Given the virtual structure of these contests there exists an array of data regarding competitor actions available online as a result of their digital traces. In this talk we will look at some techniques within the R programming language that may be used to parse this data via webscraping procedures. We will then describe one such example study focussing specifically on the Fantasy Premier League, the fantasy equivalent of the top division within English soccer. In particular we will consider visual techniques from the Tidyverse suite of packages that allow a descriptive story regarding the science of success behind those competitors who perform well in the game to be developed.<\/p> <p># Sponsors #JumpingRivers<\/p> <p>The event will be sponsored by Jumping Rivers.<\/p> <p>Jumping Rivers is an analytics company whose passion is data and machine learning.<br/><a href=\"https://www.jumpingrivers.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.jumpingrivers.com/<\/a><br/>twitter: twitter.com/jumping_uk<br/>linkedin: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/<\/a><\/p> "

So how do you get your R scripts to run? In this talk I hope to inspire lone data scientists on all the ways you can run your Rscript in the cloud. I cover some simple and more advanced use cases for running R in the cloud. I also talk about cooperating with IT for maximum results.<\/p> <p># Speaker<br/>I'm a maker, I love to build useful (machine learning) tools for people and I love sharing what I learned. I have been working in researcher, data scientist and machine learning engineer roles for the past years. I want to make it easy, convenient and simple for everyone to run their R work in the cloud.

The formula syntax is very similar to that of the lme4 package to provide a familiar and simple interface for performing regression analyses. A wide range of response distributions are supported, allowing users to fit – among others – linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, and even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include non-linear and smooth terms, auto-correlation structures, censored data, missing value imputation, and quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the response distribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional regression. Multivariate models, i.e., models with multiple response variables, can be fit as well. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that reflect their beliefs. Model fits can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive checks, cross-validation, and Bayes factors.<\/p> <p># Speaker<\/p> <p>Paul is a statistician currently working as an Independent Junior Research Group Leader at the Cluster of Excellence SimTech at the University of Stuttgart (Germany). He is the author of the R package brms and member of the Stan Development Team. Previously, he studied Psychology and Mathematics at the Universities of Münster and Hagen (Germany) and did his PhD in Münster about optimal design and Bayesian data analysis. He has also worked as a Postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science at Aalto University (Finland).<\/p> <p># Sponsors #JumpingRivers<\/p> <p>The event will be sponsored by Jumping Rivers.<\/p> <p>Jumping Rivers is an analytics company whose passion is data and machine learning. <a href=\"https://www.jumpingrivers.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.jumpingrivers.com/<\/a><\/p> <p>twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jumping_uk\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/jumping_uk<\/a><br/>linkedin: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/<\/a><\/p> "

Kaelen will introduce the topic of flexdashboards.<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Session title: Let’s Build a Flexdashboard!<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>Abstract: Don’t want to stand up an entire Shiny app to make a quick dashboard, but you know RMarkdown? Enter flexdashboard, which allows you to create a dashboard using a RMarkdown file. In this short workshop, we’ll build a flexdashboard by exploring and visualizing metrics for a pre-specified open dataset. We’ll learn the basics of flexdashboard while brainstorm dashboard design ideas, calculate and display our metrics, and discuss possible deployment options.<\/p> <p>Bio: Kaelen is a data scientist at Medidata Solutions where they work as an R programmer on the microservices team. They've also worked at Spring Health, DataCamp, HERE Technologies, and have done a fair amount of R and Shiny consulting on the side. Kaelen has been at various times in their life a film theorist, preschool teacher, test prep tutor, videographer, and nanny before getting a MS in Biostatistics from LSU Health Sciences Center in 2016 and starting work as a statistician and data scientist. Outside of work they enjoy podcasts, cats, aliens, nail polish, and data.<\/p> <p>Twitter: twitter.com/kaelen_medeiros<\/p> <p>Website: klmedeiros.com<\/p> <p>*************************************************************************<\/p> <p>You are encouraged to click the link below to keep up with the group project and to join the Slack community.

But, if you type in \"white girls,\" the results are radically different. The suggested porn sites and un-moderated discussions about \"why black women are so sassy\" or \"why black women are so angry\" presents a disturbing portrait of black womanhood in modern society.<\/p> <p>In Algorithms of Oppression, Safiya Umoja Noble challenges the idea that search engines like Google offer an equal playing field for all forms of ideas, identities, and activities. Data discrimination is a real social problem; Noble argues that the combination of private interests in promoting certain sites, along with the monopoly status of a relatively small number of Internet search engines, leads to a biased set of search algorithms that privilege whiteness and discriminate against people of color, specifically women of color.<\/p> <p>Through an analysis of textual and media searches as well as extensive research on paid online advertising, Noble exposes a culture of racism and sexism in the way discoverability is created online. As search engines and their related companies grow in importance-operating as a source for email, a major vehicle for primary and secondary school learning, and beyond-understanding and reversing these disquieting trends and discriminatory practices is of utmost importance.<\/p> <p>An original, surprising and, at times, disturbing account of bias on the internet, Algorithms of Oppression contributes to our understanding of how racism is created, maintained, and disseminated in the 21st century.<\/p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> "

When I felt confined by a CMS with limited capability of working with interactive graphics (and lack of D3 skills), Flourish came to my rescue. With built-in templates, it creates interactive maps, charts, and tables in seconds. Add a few tips and tricks to work around some of the limitations, anyone can create beautiful interactives customizable to your needs.<\/p> "
