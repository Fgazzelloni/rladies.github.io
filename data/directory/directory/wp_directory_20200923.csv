 	<li>As the Lead Clinical Bioinformatician in the Pathology Department of the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, I work on improving bioinformatic processes for clinical use of Next Generation Sequencing. Prior to that, I was working at Monash Health where I established bioinformatic pipelines for clinical exomes and other NGS data such as RNAseq and ChIPseq. My passion for bringing personalized medicine into Human health care drives my commitment to ensure best practices are used through pipeline validation for NGS-based diagnostic tests.My passion for capoeira, a Brazilian martial art, has helped me gain confidence both personally and professionally; and I now aim at helping other women find their own. I have become an advocate for gender equality and a strong supporter of women in science, who I believe deserve to be recognized for all the hard work and talent they have brought, and continue to bring, to the exciting field that is science.</li>

I like to teach / empower people to enjoy the data analytic process instead of seeing it as burden: it is always an adventure. Developing material for books and wiring scientific papers that provide complete scripts of reproducible research is my main focus these days.

Working with data is always about working out how to get the most elegant solution possible to tricky business issues from the technology available; a challenge that Kate steps up to every time! As a data scientist at Mango Solutions, she delivers analytics consultancy and training to a whole host of super imaginative customers who have an amazing thirst for learning. Specialising in helping customers define and secure their data architecture, Kate has the privilege of working with both Mango’s awesomely clever mathematical types who want R and Python to slowly take over the world, and our thoroughly brilliant data engineers who serve up complex technology as quickly as you can say “cloud computing”. As for what she means about “being sneaky”, you’ll just have to ask her.</li>

 	<li>I love to educate and empower others to learn R and data analysis and visualization in order to transition their careers, and I truly believe that non-profits are a great starting point for many people relatively new to data. I'm currently planning an online learning community centered around helping others learn R - as well as data analysis and visualization - using Hadley Wickham's ""R for Data Science"" text. I plan to take the learnings from this to grow and expand the opportunity in the coming years!</li>

 	<li><strong>Interests:</strong> I’m interested in developing novel statistical methods to address scientific questions related to the environment. My applications areas include climate, weather forecast, and veterinary. My dissertation was about spatiotemporal modeling, variable selection and Bayesian model averaging, but I have also worked in other projects applying non-spatial variable selection methods, functional data analysis and other tools to construct and evaluate forecasting models.</li>

We all have a role in preserving antibiotics for the future and it starts with you right now by washing your hands and preventing the spread of germs. Get plenty of rest and drink fluids when you have a cold. Listen to your nurses instead of demanding treatment first instead of waiting for confirmatory results from diagnostic tests. Be open to other strategies when you've got the flu or strep throat.</li>

 	<li><strong>Interests:</strong> My main subject is to understand the population dynamics of the Black Sea Anchovy. Moreover, stock assessment of the anchovy and turbot stock (GFCM, SGSABS) of the Black Sea. In laboratory works; I read age from the fish otoliths. I produce not only biological data for the stock assessment model but also create index data about the growth pattern of the anchovy which will be modelled (during my PhD) to understand the environmental effects (temperature, Chl-a, Eddy Kinetic Energy) on anchovy growth. I use R mainly in fish stock assessment models as XSA and SAM.</li>
