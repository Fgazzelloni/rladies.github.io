<p><a href="https://rladies.org/united-states-rladies/name/gabriela-de-queiroz/">Gabriela de Queiroz</a> founded R-Ladies on October 1, 2012. She wanted to give back to the community after going to several meetups and learning a lot for free. The first meetup was placed in San Francisco, California (United States).</p>
<p>In the following years two more R-Ladies chapters started around the globe: Twin Cities and Taipei. R-Ladies London was the fourth chapter, which launched in March 2016. Although each chapter started working independently, the need for high-level coordination and support became evident at useR! 2016 where the San Francisco and London chapters met.</p>
<p>After some initial brainstorming during the useR! 2016 conference, <a href="https://rladies.org/united-states-rladies/name/gabriela-de-queiroz/">Gabriela de Queiroz</a> and <a href="https://rladies.org/r-speakers/name/erin-ledell/">Erin LeDell</a> from R-Ladies San Francisco and <a href="https://rladies.org/r-speakers/name/chiin-rui-tan/">Chiin-Rui Tan</a>, <a href="https://rladies.org/ladies-complete-list/name/alice-daish/">Alice Daish</a>, <a href="https://rladies.org/ladies-complete-list/name/hannah-frick/">Hannah Frick</a>, <a href="https://rladies.org/ladies-complete-list/name/rachel-kirkham/">Rachel Kirkham</a> and <a href="https://rladies.org/r-speakers/name/claudia-vitolo/">Claudia Vitolo</a> from R-Ladies London as well as Heather Turner teamed up to apply for an R-Consortium <a href="https://github.com/rladies/global/blob/master/rconsortium/FINAL%20-%20201607-%20rconsortiumproposalr-ladiesalignmentandglobalexpansion-july2016.pdf">grant to support and encourage the global expansion of the R-Ladies organisation</a>.</p>
<p>R-Ladies Global was born and the grant was awarded in September 2016. Since then R-Ladies has grown to 63 chapters and 13000 members, thanks to our amazing organisers and R-Ladies who helped build and maintain our official website (<a href="https://rladies.org/">rladies.org</a>), engage with the larger community via social media - (<a href="https://twitter.com/rladiesglobal?lang=en">@RLadiesGlobal</a>) and help each-other every day in millions of different ways.</p>
