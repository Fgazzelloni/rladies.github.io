_This blog post is a condensed format of the [official statement R-Ladies Global made via Twitter](https://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal/status/1114507499728769024), in a form that is easier to share for non Twitter-users._

# Why we condem DataCamp's handling of sexual assault

We are very disappointed by the way DataCamp handled the sexual assault of an employee by a C-level executive. We strongly support the target who is a member of our community and condemn DataCamp for their lack of accountability and transparency around this issue. As remarked by [`just_reply`](https://twitter.com/no_reply/status/1113923302915837958), DataCamp "quietly published [a "community" post](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/note-to-our-community) , in which they admit an executive sexually assaulted ("uninvited physical contact") an employee."

We applaud the collective action from the DataCamp instructor community for pushing for this accountability and transparency. As [explained by Erin LeDell](https://twitter.com/ledell/status/1114238844503609344), "After *many months* of collective negotiating by the instructor community to demand more transparency & accountability, [DataCamp] still did nothing. Their public announcement is a response to a letter we sent to DataCamp one day prior, signed by over 100 DataCamp instructors.".

We are not satisfied with the response from DataCamp. As underlined by [Julia Silge](https://twitter.com/juliasilge/status/1113996214561923072) and [Mara Averick](https://twitter.com/dataandme/status/1113939480300355584), the post used "details in victim-blaming ways".

# How can you stand up for more accountability?

If you are unsatisfied with their actions & response, you can use your voice and your wallet to vote for more accountability. Below we are summarizing ideas from a [thread started by Jesse Mostipak](https://twitter.com/kierisi/status/1113945904698892289), with contributions from [Chris Engelhardt](https://twitter.com/EngelhardtCR), [Laura Ación](https://twitter.com/_lacion_/status/1113960425174052864), [Bruna Wunderwald](https://twitter.com/bwundervald/status/1114907322441244672), [Erin LeDell](https://twitter.com/ledell/status/1115138789293211649).

1. Cancel your subscription.

2. Cancel your organization's subscription.

3. Remove links/recommendations to use DataCamp from your material.

4. Stop developing content/lectures for them. Folks who are not customers can alter behavior as well.

5. Take your DataCamp stickers off your laptop/car/water bottle/ etc. 

6. Just say "No" when they ask you to do a podcast.

7. Don't accept DataCamp as a sponsor of events you organize.

8. Delete your account (even if you don't have a paid subscription anymore).

9. Remove your tweets containing “DataCamp" by searching `DataCamp from:@youruser` (replace `@youruser` by your own handle) in Twitter search and deleting the old tweets that endorsed they in any way.

10. Unfollow Datacamp from social media like Twitter, Facebook, etc.

11. If you are working on a course or project for DataCamp, you can put your work on hold until you feel that appropriate and sufficient action has been taken on behalf of DataCamp.

Let's keep working on a safe community for everyone!
