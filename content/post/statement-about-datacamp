_This blog post is a condensed format of the [official statement R-Ladies Global made via Twitter](https://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal/status/1114507499728769024), in a form that is easier to share for non Twitter-users._

We are very disappointed by the way @DataCamp handled the sexual assault of an employee by a C-level executive. We strongly support the target who is a member of our community and condemn DataCamp for their lack of accountability and transparency around this issue. As remarked by [`just_reply` on Twitter](https://twitter.com/no_reply/status/1113923302915837958), DataCamp "[a "community" post](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/note-to-our-community) , in which they admit an executive sexually assaulted ("uninvited physical contact") an employee."
