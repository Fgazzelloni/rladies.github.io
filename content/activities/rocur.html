<h3>The R-Ladies RoCur</h3>
</div>
<div id="about" class="section level2">
<h2>About</h2>
<p>The <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies">R-Ladies RoCur (Rotating Curation)</a></strong> is a twitter handle that will feature an awesome R-Lady each week. This account is run by R-Ladies Global.</p>
</div>
<div id="objectives" class="section level2">
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>To encourage and maintain Twitter engagement within the R-Ladies community.<br />
</li>
<li>To spotlight female and minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender) and their great work in R.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="how-it-works" class="section level2">
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>Every week, a different R-Lady takes over our twitter account to talk about the work they do in R. Featured curators come from a diversity of professions and have a range of experiences in R, from novice to expert.</p>
<p>If you are interested in becoming a curator, see our <em>Be a Curator</em> section (below) and <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/bQ7mHQDXrNHXEZCl2">sign up here</a>.</p>
<p>Check out <span class="citation">[@WeAreRLadies]</span>(<a href="https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies" class="uri">https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies</a>) every Monday for a new curator!</p>

<h2>Be a Curator!</h2>
<p>We are always looking for R-users to be a featured curator for our account! Everyone is welcome; R-Ladies encourages R-users of all professional backgrounds and experience levels to curate this account. Additionally, individuals do not need to be affiliated with R-Ladies to curate. Featured curators must meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Curators must identify as female or non-binary.<br />
</li>
<li>Curators do not need to be affiliated with R-Ladies; however, curators need to register in the <a href="https://rladies.org/directory/">R-Ladies directory</a> if they haven’t yet.<br />
</li>
<li>Curators must be individuals (i.e. an R-Ladies Chapter cannot be a featured curator; however, an organizer from a local chapter may curate and tweet about chapter events).<br />
</li>
<li>By signing on to be a curator of <span class="citation">@WeAreRLadies</span> you agree to our Curator Agreement that is outlined in our <a href="https://github.com/katherinesimeon/starter-kit/blob/master/RoCur-Twitter/files/RLadies-Rocur-Guide.md">RoCur Curator Guide</a>.</li>
