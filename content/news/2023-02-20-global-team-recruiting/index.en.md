# TL; DR

The R-Ladies Global Team is recruiting new members!
Please fill [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OZB6eVrsocvRyqD-ec5ui69SfXuOR8AZ_L-33B2d5yM/edit?pli=1){target="\_blank"} to submit yourself for consideration.

# Background

The R-Ladies Global Team is made of volunteers that dedicate a few hours per week to the management of the global organization.
We want to build a diverse team with good representation of all community members.

# Timeline (approximate)

-   date1-date2: Google form is open to submissions (2 weeks)

-   date3-date4: Global team reviews submissions (2 weeks)

-   date5-date6: Target date to notify individuals of selection.
    (1 week)

-   date7-date8: Invitation to meet with 1-3 global team members to clarify any questions or expectations to ensure a good match for all parties.
    (2 weeks)

# Selection considerations

We will consider various aspects with the aim of increasing the diversity of the team.
The following are not an exhaustive list of requirements but rather an illustration of the various paths possible.
A new team member is not expected to satisfy all criteria.

-   Geographical location

-   Demographic characteristics like ethnicity, age, and gender identity

-   Background and experience such as education, skills, and knowledge \<--Note: if we keep this here then the google form should be ammended to capture this--\>

-   R-Ladies/R community involvement

# Benefits

By participating in R-Ladies you are helping other women or gender minorities by creating a safe space to learn, teach, and develop, as well as build out a support network and contacts.

Some of the personal benefits that we think come with joining the global team and volunteering time are gaining experience in leadership, asynchronous remote work, international team work, not-for-profit open-source work, and work in a women(+) only team and organization.

Depending on the role, there also may be opportunities for technical upskilling.
For example, some members of the Global team use R, reproducible reports, git/GitHub, GitHub Actions, Hugo website development, and integrations with data bases.
(Knowledge of these tools is not a requirement for selection; the Global team will provide training on processes specific to your role.)

# Commitment

We ask those seeking consideration to commit to one year of 1 to 4 hours a week for service to the Global Team.
Of course, vacations and exceptions may occur.
