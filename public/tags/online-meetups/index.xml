      <description>Our chapters have cancelled in-person meetups due to the corona virus pandemic.

To support our chapter organisers in moving their events online, we decided to provide them with video conferencing infrastructure.
Our network has grown to over 160 chapters worldwide so we were wondering how many meeting rooms we would need.</description>
